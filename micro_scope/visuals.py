# 📈 Spread Over Time
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Uses seaborn to plot bid-ask price spread over time.
# Helps detect signs of market stress or liquidity holes — e.g., spread widening during news.
# Execution teams can spot periods where it's expensive to trade.
# Volatility in spread = degraded market conditions.

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# ⚖️ Order Imbalance Over Time (Line or Area Plot)
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Visualizes supply/demand pressure (skew toward buyers or sellers).
# Large positive imbalance = buyer pressure, negative = seller pressure.
# Helps anticipate short-term drift in prices.
# Add horizontal shaded bands to indicate:
#   - Neutral zone (e.g. between -0.1 and 0.1)
#   - Strong buyer zone (e.g. > 0.3)
#   - Strong seller zone (e.g. < -0.3)
# Used by market makers and infra teams to detect stress conditions.

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 🔥 Trade Intensity (Bar Chart or Heatmap)
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Shows number of trades per second (or time bucket).
# A proxy for market activity and volume flow.
# Low activity = slippage risk; high activity = potential latency, adverse selection.
# Execution and timing strategies depend on this.
# Optional advanced version: heatmap with:
#   - X-axis = time buckets
#   - Y-axis = asset/symbol
#   - Color scale = trade count

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# ⚠️ Decision Timeline (Color-coded Market Summary)
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Visualizes the decision output ("Good" vs. "Bad" time to trade) as a timeline.
# X-axis = time
# Y-axis = binary or categorical market state
# Use color-coded bars or labels to represent tradeability:
#   - ✅ Green = Good time to trade
#   - ⚠️ Yellow/Red = Risky or bad time to trade
# Helps humans quickly understand market conditions over time.

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 💡 Optional: Spread vs Intensity (Scatter Plot)
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Each point represents a time sample:
#   - X = trade intensity
#   - Y = bid-ask spread
# Useful for identifying correlation between activity and market tightness.
# Reveals structural patterns or abnormal behavior (e.g., wide spreads in low-activity markets).
# Great for diagnostics and anomaly detection.


# make directory in reports/graphs for graph data, name of directory is key generated value, search for key generated value in reports, then
# put visuals in keyvalue/graphs folder
